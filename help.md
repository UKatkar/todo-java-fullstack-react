1. Creating React UI Application

    Pre-requisites:
   	Latest version of Node JS 
        NPM - package manager: Install, delete, and update JS package (npm --version)
	NPX - package executor: Executes js packages without installing (npx --version)

    Using Create React App:
        Got to YOUR_FOLDER, where you want to create react project
            cd <your_folder>
        Create React App with create-react-app
            npx create-react-app todo-app

            OUTPUT:
                Success! Created todo-app at D:\Learning\Spring and Spring boot Framework with JAVA - Udemy\todo-java-fullstack-react\todo-app
                Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

                npm start
                    Starts the development server.

                npm run build
                    Bundles the app into static files for production.

                npm test
                    Starts the test runner.

                npm run eject
                    Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
                    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!

                We suggest that you begin by typing:

                cd todo-app
                npm start

                Happy hacking!
